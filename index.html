                    <p>My name is Federico Gomez Kennel, AKA GoofyGomez. I am a 25-year-old voice actor from Argentina. I discovered my love for literature from a very young age, when my grandpa used to read Greek myth books to me before bed. I As I got older, I began reading more and more books in English to satisfy that need for adventure and fantasy, my two favorite genres. Going into my High School years, I participated in a number of Writing Competitions (winning some of them), which only fueled my passion for creating.</p>

                        <p>Thank you for writing your heart out; very much enjoyed it.
                            When you put it like that, yeah, it's a little nuts. Never have I ever read anything as fast as I did this. My bookworm wife was very surprised too. The work warmed my soul. I look forward to your writing in the future (but no pressure :) ).</p>

                            <p>I loved Alma and Thalia (Thalma). They gave strong Lumity vibes which was awesome, and like you said, it must have been very difficult to execute without being cheesy or inorganic. I know that Alma was an OC from Mexfan12 but was Thalia as well? I hope I'm not bothering you too much, but I'm curious, how much would you say you developed them from the concepts from Mexfan12's work?</p>

                            <p>Thalia's loss of everyone in her life pre-Alma was so painfully heartbreaking, well-written, and developed. Alma and Thalia working together to raise Thalia's confidence and strengths was special. I loved her mentorship with Viney and her gift from Raine to develop her unconventional multitrack education. If you couldn't tell, her growth from scared, helpless orphan to a brave, powerful rebel-witch and partner of Alma was one of my favorite parts of this fic. I hope if things don't “work out” in chapter 36, she can find solace in what remains of her found family.</p>
                            
                            </p>Thank you so much for your year of hard work. I'm both excited and terrified for tomorrow!</p>
