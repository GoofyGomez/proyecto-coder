                <p>My name is Federico Gomez Kennel, AKA GoofyGomez. I am a 25-year-old voice actor from Argentina. I discovered my love for literature from a very young age, when my grandpa used to read Greek myth books to me before bed. I As I got older, I began reading more and more books in English to satisfy that need for adventure and fantasy, my two favorite genres. Going into my High School years, I participated in a number of Writing Competitions (winning some of them), which only fueled my passion for creating. After I graduated, I began looking into fanfiction as an outlet for the untapped potential of the books, games, and TV shows I was already a fan of.</p>
                
                <p>I began writing, first within the Harry Potter fandom, then moving onto other projects and fandoms as inspiration took hold of me. Over the years, I have met some amazing online friends through this medium, whom I may not have ever known had it not been for the art of fanfiction. In 2023, I even managed to meet a few of them in real life, which is something I never thought would be possible.</p>

                <p>6 years after starting this journey, I have written over 60 separate fanfictions of varying length, totaling nearly 775,000 words and amassing 194,000 hits and over 8,500 kudos. My dream is to write a book of my own, and with the experience I have gained these wonderful 6 years, I hope to achieve it one day.</p>
